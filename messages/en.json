    "labelPlatformDescription": "Project created mainly with Next.Js, Next UI and Prisma. Its objective is to optimize shipping management by grouping equal orders. The platform allows users to complete a single order or group multiple identical orders into a single set. The process works as follows: Users enter their orders on the platform. The interface automatically detects orders that contain the same products. The same orders are grouped, allowing users to manage them together. This not only simplifies the shipping process, but can also reduce costs and processing time. Users can choose to complete an order individually or the set of orders grouped together. Once the user decides to complete the order (individual or joint), the system automatically generates a shipping label. This label includes all the information necessary to dispatch the package by mail. The main benefit of this system is the improved efficiency in order and shipping management, allowing for a faster and more economical process. Bundling orders also reduces the number of shipments required, contributing to more sustainable practices.",
