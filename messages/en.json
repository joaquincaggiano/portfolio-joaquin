The interface automatically detects orders that contain the same products. The same orders are grouped, allowing users to manage them together. This not only simplifies the shipping process, but can also reduce costs and processing time. Users can choose to complete an order individually or the set of orders grouped together. Once the user decides to complete the order (individual or joint), the system automatically generates a shipping label. This label includes all the information necessary to dispatch the package by mail. The main benefit of this system is the improved efficiency in order and shipping management, allowing for a faster and more economical process. Bundling orders also reduces the number of shipments required, contributing to more sustainable practices.",
